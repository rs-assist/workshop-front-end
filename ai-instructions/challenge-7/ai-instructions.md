I would like you to add a delete button that calls the respective endpoint for the operations page.

- The button should be placed in the modal of the operation and automatically remove the entry from the database and refresh the operations visible.
- The modal should be automatically closed and maybe show a toast of the status.

If there is no endpoint, you should create it.
For the button, use a simple one from shad/cn.
