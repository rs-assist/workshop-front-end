The dashboard of the app should contain different sections (in a drawer):
- system overview
    - list of servers running and their data
    - an activity log
    - chart with missions completed / failed
- agents overview
    - list of all the agents and their data (where they are deployed, their mission, the risk, etc)
- operations
    - list of all the operations with different cards, that when clicked on should open a modal with data of the mission
- intelligence reports
    - different analysis (with location, priority and secret level)
    - stats about the analysis (total documents, sources, etc)

The drawer should also contain a widget with the current overall servers status





I want the drawer to be located in the right side and should be opened by default on larger screens. Also, any statistics should be at the top of the pages
