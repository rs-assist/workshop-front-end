Let's start by creating an api folder under /app.

Using the prisma schema file, create me all the CRUD endpoints required.

Use whatever you might see it fit in the project.

Use hono.dev to handle APIs. See an example: https://github.com/u1aryz/next-hono-rpc-example/tree/main/app

Split the entire project into features. Starting with the API folder and then with the app folder into so-called "features". You decide what the features are. Use the SWR hook to get the data from the API.
