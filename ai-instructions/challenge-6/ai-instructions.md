Let's split pages into multiple components. Most of them are already marked with a comment containing the component name.

Create in each page a folder called "components" where they will be stored as a .tsx file with a kebab name-style.

Components such as PageTitle and PageSubtitle should be stored in the app/components folder. Others should be put in their respective folder, judging by their prefix (e.g. Opt -> Operations, Cmd -> Command Center, Agt -> Agent Network). When you're done, replace the old code with the components.
No need for comments. I do only care about the result.
